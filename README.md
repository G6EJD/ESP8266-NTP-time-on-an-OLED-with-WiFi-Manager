# ESP8266-NTP-time-on-an-OLED-with-WiFi-Manager

**** YOU MUST USE THE DISPLAY DRIVER (1306) PROVIDED **** 

An ESP8266 displays accurate time using NTP on an OLED display, using the WiFi Manager to make a network connection.
So, place the sketch and Adafruit_ssd1306.cpp and .h files in the same folder

DST adjustment rules have been refined and now support correct time change-over.
